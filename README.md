# ML-and-DL-on-Cryptos
Machine Learning-Driven Long/Short Pair Trading Strategies in Cryptocurrencies Project
The results were computed and implemented using Python, hosted in Google Colab Notebook. The components of the notebook are: 
#1. Environment Set-up
#2. Cryptocurrency data extraction
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Cointegration test (Pair Trading)
5. Feature engineering
6. Random Forest Modelling
7. LSTM deep learning modelling
8. Ensemble model (risk-adjusted measures)
9. Backtesting (Long/Short Pairs)
10. Evaluation Metrics
